Normalization by Evaluation for Dependent Type Theory: Implementation in Coq and Overview

## Abstract

Understanding a logical expression can sometime be cumbersome. An expression can have a simple semantic while is represented in a complex syntax structure; or two expressions with the same semantic can be represented by different forms. These examples cause the understanding of logical expression unmanageable. As a solution, Normalization by Evaluation (NbE) is a technique used to simplify logical construct by evaluating its structure into a consistent semantic form. NbE aids in type checking and inferencing, in theorem proving, and is generally an essential tool in computer science.
